# RAG-Application-with-LangChain-and-HuggingFace-LLM
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Chatbot built using LangChain and HuggingFace Large Language Models (LLMs). The chatbot is designed to provide accurate, context-aware answers by retrieving relevant information from a custom knowledge base instead of relying only on the model’s pre-trained knowledge.
